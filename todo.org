* Development
** TODO Need to address this note now popping up in build checks.
    Note: found 88 marked UTF-8 strings
** TODO Need to ensure R Markdown renders correctly without goalie issues.
** TODO Require valid names in all slots.
** TODO Add monocle celldataset coercion method.
** TODO Need to run BFG on the repo and remove old example R data.
** TODO `bcbioSingleCell()`: Explain genome annotation priority in better detail, following the logic defined in `bcbioRNASeq()`.
** TODO Improve support for transcript-level counts?
    Should we even allow this at this point?
** TODO Vignette using example bcbio data and 10X pbmc data.
** TODO Look into BarcodeInflectionsPlot, now in Seurat 3.
* pointillism
** TODO Move markers out of Google Sheets and into the package, as simple CSV files.
** TODO Use pseudobulk approach for DE with sample replicates
** TODO `plotFeature()`: Add `pointsAsNumbers` argument support.
** TODO `diffExp()`: Add internal support for accessing design with `design()` generic.
** TODO `KnownMarkers` S4: switch from DataFrame to SplitDataFrameList inheritance?
** TODO Improve SeuratMarkers class.
    This needs to error if the input data.frame contains `cluster` column.
    Consider only using `SeuratMarkers` as a single generator but returning `SeuratMarkers` or `SeuratMarkersPerCluster` automatically.
    Allow generator to work with empty ranges?
** TODO Improve plotFeature.
    Add pointsAsNumbers support. Is there a way to facet wrap these instead of using plot grid? Then we can easily support a title. We're using continuous color here, so the formal won't matchâ€¦ argument "color" is missing, with no default.
** TODO `findMarkers()`: Consider adding `progress` option or BPPARAM support.
** TODO Switch to `Misc()` to access the `@misc` slot?
** TODO Consider splitting `SeuratMarkers` class into a `DataFrameList`, per cluster.
** TODO Stacked bar plot for relative cell abundances per cluster or sample type.
** TODO Put the resolution in the plot title for t-SNE.
** TODO Add `write = TRUE` argument support for marking looping functions, to write CSVs automatically to disk.
** TODO Improve assert checks for `findMarkers()`
* syntactic
** TODO saveData: Need to harden against accidential pipe to this function.
** TODO Check that renaming mode renames symlinks themselves, not the resolved file.
    I ran into this attempting to name album artist symlinks in iTunes.
** TODO VIGNETTE. Seriously, work on it.
** TODO Functions need to convert accent marks if possible. Particularly useful for file names.
** TODO Ensure nM returns as nm instead of n_m.
** TODO Rename mode: Need to look for and strip ' - ' out automatically.
    Otherwise this will return '-minus-' in the file name, which is annoying. Need to improve the internal sanitization in R for this.
** TODO Rename mode needs to also make extension lowercase.
** TODO Need to add recursive rename mode support (koopa only?).
    Maybe this is easiest to implement on the R side of things. Need to rename files first, then directories, sorted. Need to work from lowest levels up.
** TODO nMito, nCoding looks weird with makeLabel plural.
    See bcbioSingleCell example.
